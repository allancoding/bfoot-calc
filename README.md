# Board To Foot Calculator

This is a calculator that you can use to calculate the price of your woods project after designing it.

## Usage

Go to the [calculator](https://bfoot-calc.allancoding.dev/) and input the dimensions of each board in you project. Then you can add the price. The calculator will then calculate the price of the project based on the dimensions you input and price of wood.

## Development

Download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allancoding/bfoot-calc.git
```

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This project is for my WebDev class at Southwest Tech
